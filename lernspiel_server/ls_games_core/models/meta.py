    Concrete variant of a game type defining the appearance and overall rule set of
    the game. A game type could be "Quiz" as implemented by the corresponding Django app.
    Game variants could then be "TV Show", "Questionnaire" etc.

    Game variants contain multiple media files and source files that are loaded by the
    frontend to be executed in the web browser. Developers can use the Game SDK to build,
    test and deploy new game variants.
