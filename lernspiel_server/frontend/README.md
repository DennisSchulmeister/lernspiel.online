Lernspiel Online Core Frontend
====================

This is the JavaScript / TypeScript code for the Lernspiel Online Core Frontend. It is mainly used
to pull external libraries from the NPM package index and build a distribution bundle.
It also defines an in-browser API for game developers. But except for the games, all other
content is rendered server-side with little to no JavaScript code running in the browser.
